# Group-Project-2
gp2-1.py puts the double loop i,j in the main part, rather than in the defined functions.

gp2-2.py makes a movie of the sharks and fish while they swim

gp2-3.py Fixes the movement of shark and fish--please double check this (I had to make many changes).

GP_Assignment_2.tex /.pdf is the document 

Things left to do:
-- Write document
-- Make presentation
-- save snapshots of the system configuration
-- make movies for different initial conditions
